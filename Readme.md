Learning how to use git hub

Best git hub Tutorial you liked / used : Self-taught, been doing this for years.

Tool used :  Git CLI or VS/VS Code GUI

I have used git mostly in VS/VS Code's built-in GUIs but I have also used it in command line directly from linux enough to get around. I do C# and web development so VS/VS Code is natural.
